[P] and [[desk,chair|[lamp|[]]]|Q]
Yes.
Steps:
[[desk,chair|[lamp]]|Q]
[[desk,chair,lamp]|Q]
P = [desk,chair,lamp]
Q = []
LHS = RHS

[eng|[Q|[R|S]]] and [R|[Q|AI721]]
Yes
[eng|[Q, R|S]] = [R, Q|AI721]
[eng, Q, R|S] = [R, Q|AI721]
R = eng
[eng, Q, eng|S] = [eng, Q|AI721]
AI721 = [eng|S]
[eng, Q, eng|S] = [eng, Q|[eng|S]]
[eng, Q, eng|S] = [eng, Q, eng|S]
LHS = RHS

[[R|S],[R]|S] and [[P|Q],[Q],x,y] 
Yes
S = [x,y]
[[R,x,y],[R],x,y] = [[P|Q],[Q],x,y] 
Q = [x,y]
[[R,x,y],[R],x,y] = [[P,x,y],[[x,y]],x,y] 
R = [x,y]
P = [x,y]
[[[x,y],x,y],[[x,y]],x,y] = [[[x,y],x,y],[[x,y]],x,y] 
LHS = RHS

[Var|[[d],d]] and [const,X|X]
Yes
[Var, [d], d] = [const,X|X]
Var = const
X = [d]
[const, [d],d] = [const, [d]|[d]]
[const, [d],d] = [const, [d],d]
LHS = RHS

[P,Q,[a,Q]] and [a,b,[R|[R]]]
Doesn't work.
[P,Q,[a,Q]] and [a,b,[R,R]]
In order for it to work here, R = a and R = Q, and Q = b.
LHS != RHS

[Z,d|Z] and [[]|[d,[]]]
Doesn't work.
Lists cannot start with an [], and that is the only thing Z could equal here
LHS != RHS

[j,[k,l,m],l,m] and [j,[k,|LIST],LIST]
Doesn't work.
In order to match the part [k,l,m] then LIST = [l,m] but there is a difference between the ending of [j,[...],l,m] and [j,[...],[l,m]]
LHS != RHS

[ryerson,P,Q|R] and [Q|[[cs,Q]|[ryerson|P]]]
Yes
[ryerson,P,Q|R] = [Q|[[cs,Q],ryerson|P]]
[ryerson,P,Q|R] = [Q,[cs,Q],ryerson|P]
Q = ryerson
[ryerson,P,ryerson|R] = [ryerson,[cs,ryerson],ryerson|P]
P =[cs,ryerson]
[ryerson,[cs,ryerson],ryerson|R] = [ryerson,[cs,ryerson],ryerson|[cs,ryerson]]
R = [cs,ryerson]
[ryerson,[cs,ryerson],ryerson|[cs,ryerson]] = [ryerson,[cs,ryerson],ryerson|[cs,ryerson]]
[ryerson,[cs,ryerson],ryerson,cs,ryerson] = [ryerson,[cs,ryerson],ryerson,cs,ryerson]
LHS = RHS
